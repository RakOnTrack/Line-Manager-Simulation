what is this queue stuff for the first part of workstation?
    those orders names dont have anyting to do with queues. 
    what is it even talking about?? queues that data structure or a line ?

for the LM run function, i dont know how it decided to fill the orders for each iteration.


i dont know why theres   Processed Orders (incomplete)  section.


what is a double ended queue?

are the global variables member variables? or enum?
    should the global variables be static?
